Algorithm overview for the ALS encoder:


Stage: Channel Sorting
    Speed:          Determined by user defined channel layout
    Compression:    Determined by user defined channel layout
    Compromise:     Determined by user defined channel layout

Stage: Frame Partitioning
    Speed:          Fixed frame sizes for different encoding parameters.
    Compression:    Fixed frame sizes for different encoding parameters.
    Compromise:     Fixed frame sizes for different encoding parameters.

Stage: Block Partitioning
    Speed:          Off
    Compression:    Trellis search for rate-optimal partitioning.
    Compromise:     A)  a faster algorithm using difference of sum of simple
                        prediction residual between adjacent sub-blocks
                        (similar to the variable block size algorithm in Flake)
                    B)  varying amounts of speed/accuracy in the bit count part
                        of the trellis search
                    C)  different maximum levels of partitioning

Stage: Short-Term Prediction
    1: Calculation of Prediction Coefficients:
    Speed:          Pre-defined fixed coefficients
    Compression:    Cholesky
    Compromise:     A) Levinson-Durbin
                    B) different window functions(?)
                    C) different recusrion levels for Cholesky

    2: Selection of Prediction Order:
    Speed:          Fixed order determined at init by user and/or encoder
    Compression:    Full search using highest accuracy of all lower stages
    Compromise:     A) estimate order based on PARCOR threshold value
                    B) use less search steps
                    C) use varying levels of accuracy for lower stages in the search

Stage: Long-Term Prediction
    Speed:          Off
    Compression:    Full Search
    Compromise:     Maybe full search is fast enough. Heuristics otherwise(?)

Stage: Joint-/Multi-Channel Coding
    Speed:          Off
    Compression:    Full Search
    Compromise:     Maybe channel layout dependant
